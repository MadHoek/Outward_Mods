## Outward Definitive Edition: Akiroth's Stash Filters

This Mod adds item-filters to the stash-inventory, like we have for the player-inventory.  
Since I started to play this game, I whished for something like that. :)  
  
All credits regarding the actual coding go to Akiroth or to whoever did it.  
My part on this was only to pull it out of the broken Stashcraft, fixing the errors it threw up and to make it useable.
